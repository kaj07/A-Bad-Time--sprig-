# A Bad Time (sprig)
 Mini version of the Sans fight from Undertale created for the Sprig!

 - This is a super simple version, trying to recreate designs using the following reference image;

- This is also my first time using javascript so I am learning as I'm going. (the AI feature on the Sprig editor is very helpful though)
- I plan to include a couple easy sequences, such as jumping over obstacles, moving around them, as well as add functionality to all the buttons.
